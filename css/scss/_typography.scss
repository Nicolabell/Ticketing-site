// FONTS

//I am importing both fonts and then setting each font as a variable so that I would be able to change across the board with a variable
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat&family=Open+Sans&display=swap');


// I don't have access to the sketch file yet so I dont know which is which :) this may change:
$primary-font: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
$secondary-font: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
